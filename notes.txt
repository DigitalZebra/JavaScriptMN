Notes:

Cool libs:

- waypoints.js, jquery waypoints  http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints



SVG:
- Inkscape for SVG editing
- Raphael 
- jQuery SVG


Browser Support:
basic feature set:
 - IE 9+, FF 3+, Chrome 4+, Safari 3.2+, Opera 9+, iOS Safari 3.2+, Android Browser 3+
 - VML in IE 5+
 Source: caniuse.com

 notes:
 - SVG 1.0 in 2001, 101 in 2003 (1.1 is the most widely supported), IE 9 supports 1.1+
 - IE has VML, vector markup language, a competing technology which was deprecated in IE9 in favor of SVG.
 - SMIL animation, no IE support :(
 - Can use SVG in CSS backgrounds or SVG in image elements in most recent browsers
 - Retained mode... browser manages DOM/Scene Graph for you, editing an element causes the scene to be automatically re-rendered.
 - vector graphics... performance degrades as more objects are drawn in SVG.  This is b/c additional references kept, additional state maintained, additional updates need to happen 
 

Canvas:
- jCanvasScript
- Fabric.js
- Paper.js
- cakejs
- doodle.js
- gury.js
- http://processingjs.org/
- three.js

Browser support:
 - Chrome 4+, FF 2+, IE 9+, Opera 9+, Safari 3.1+, iOS Safari 3.2+, Android Browser 2.1+
 Source: caniuse.com
 
 notes:
 - "un-retained" mode... browser "forgets" that you drew a square, you need to remember it.  Many of the libraries listed will give you a simple scene graph to use, aiding in managing the state of your application.
 - very low level, bitmap, performance degrades as number of pixels shown increases.  Makes sense as more pixels = more time/memory.
